# PyPong :fireworks:
An old-school pong game brought to life with python

## Purpose
This is a quick personal project to experiment with python's *turtle* :turtle: module to create a simple game.

### Notes
- This can now be done more quickly and efficiently using the *Pygame* library but I wanted to start off with the basic module for building games on python so I chose to stick with Turtle. 
- This was coded in python 2.7.1 on a Windows 10 LTSC Laptop

### Tutorial
I followed @Christian Thomas' tutorial which can be found on his website linked [here](http://christianthompson.com/node/51)
